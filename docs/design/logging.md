### Logging & Printing System

We'd like to make this repository a knowledge center of generations of researchers at ZJU3DV.

- [ ] TODO: Add example of implementing new functionalities
  - [ ] Like a new type of visualization (creating reusable parts of the framework)
  - [ ] Or a whole new network (lots of components are reused)
  - [ ] Or a whole new type of model (only dataloading and visualizations are reused)
- [ ] TODO: Add docs about the CUDA semantics and pytorch intricacies
- [ ] TODO: Add docs about the dataloading and pytorch intricacies
- [ ] TODO: Add readme about the design and usage of logging system
- [ ] TODO: Add readme about timer system and torch_tb_profiler tools
- [ ] TODO: Add docs and examples about distributed training system
